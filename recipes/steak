<h1>A Beautiful Steak</h1>


    <h2>A steak is a thick cut of meat generally sliced across the muscle fibers, sometimes including a bone</h2>


    <h1>Ingredients</h1>

    <ul>
        <h1>(12-oz) New York strip or ribeye steaks or 4 (6-oz) filet mignons, about 1½ inches thick</h1>
       <h1> 1 heaping teaspoon kosher salt </h1>
      <h1>  ½ teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</h1>
      <h1> 2 tablespoons vegetable oil</h1>
       <h1> 1 tablespoon unsalted butter </h1>
     <h1>   A few sprigs fresh thyme leaves </h1>
        
        
    </ul>


    <h1>Steps</h1>
    <ol>
       <h1> To begin, pat the steaks dry with paper towels. </h1>

      <h1>  Season the steaks all over with the salt and pepper. </h1>

       <h1> Turn on your exhaust fan and heat a heavy pan (preferably cast iron or stainless steel) over medium-high heat until it's VERY hot.
        Add the oil to the pan and heat until it begins to shimmer and move fluidly around the pan. </h1>
        
        
        <h1>Carefully set the steaks in the pan, releasing them away from you so the oil doesn’t splatter in your direction. The oil should sizzle. </h1>

      <h1>  Leave the steaks alone! Avoid the temptation to peek or fiddle or flip repeatedly; the steaks need a few minutes undisturbed to develop a golden crust. 
        Flip the steaks when they release easily and the bottom is a deep-brown color, about 3 minutes. Continue to cook the steaks for another 3 to 4 minutes on the 
        second side for rare to medium-rare. (For medium, cook 4 to 5 minutes on second side; for well-done, cook 5 to 6 minutes on second side).
During the last minute of cooking, add the butter and thyme sprigs to the pan with the steaks. </h1>

<h1>If you are serving the steaks unsliced, transfer them to plates and serve hot. If you plan to slice the steaks, transfer them to a cutting board and let rest, 
    covered with aluminum foil, for 5 to 10 minutes; then slice thinly against the grain.</h1>
