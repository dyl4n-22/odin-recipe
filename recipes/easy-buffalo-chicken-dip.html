<h1>Tasty buffalo dip</h1>


    <h2>Keep the 3 ingredients you need to make this Easy Buffalo Chicken Dip on hand and you're always 35 minutes away from one of the most popular dips ever invented!  
        There's something about the combination of chicken and cheese with a rich and creamy Buffalo sauce that makes everyone happy.  This version keeps it simple- chicken, 
        Monterey Jack cheese and condensed spicy Buffalo-style cream of chicken soup, baked until hot and bubbling.  You don't need to add cream cheese or Buffalo wing sauce 
        since the creaminess and tangy spicy Buffalo flavor is already in the soup!  Jazz it up with some crumbled blue cheese, if you like, and enjoy anytime!
